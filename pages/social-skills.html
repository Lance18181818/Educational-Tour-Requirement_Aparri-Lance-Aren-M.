During our trip to Baguio, we interacted with people who spoke different languages, like Ilocano, and still
 connected easily. This experience taught me that building social skills is about understanding, listening,
  and showing respect, even when language is different.
 It showed me that strong social skills help create meaningful
  relationships across cultures and backgrounds.
