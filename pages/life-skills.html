        Our tour in Baguio helped me develop important life skills by experiencing new places and interacting
         with different people. Trying new things with my friends, like exploring the city and communicating with
          locals, taught me confidence and independence. These moments helped me grow personally and understand 
          myself better through real experiences outside the classroom.
