Visiting PAGASA in Baguio and a
 local broadcasting company allowed me to see how the concepts we
  study are applied in real workplaces. At PAGASA,
   I learned how weather data is gathered and communicated, 
   which gave me a deeper appreciation for the science behind forecasts.
    In the broadcasting company, I witnessed how news is produced and delivered, 
    showing me the importance of teamwork and accuracy. These visits made
    me realize that real-world
    experiences can teach lessons no classroom 
   can fully provide.        </p>
