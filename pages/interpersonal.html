        Our educational tour to Baguio was both exciting and meaningful, as we visited places like PMA, 
        Stone Kingdom, Mines View Park, PAGASA, and a broadcasting company. Exploring the city, sharing food like 
        coffee and strawberry taho, and interacting with locals helped me improve my social and communication 
        skills. I realized that teamwork, understanding others, and building relationships are just as important 
        as learning new things. This experience showed me how interpersonal skills grow through shared experiences,
         making memories and connections that last a lifetime.
