        The educational tour to Baguio gave me many valuable learning experiences beyond the classroom. On the 
        first day, visiting PMA, the Stone Kingdom, and Mines View Park taught me about history, culture, and 
        natural beauty, making learning more interactive and fun. The second day’s company visits showed how real
         workplaces operate, giving me insights into teamwork, technology, and professional skills. On the third 
         day, the seminar helped me gain knowledge and ideas directly from experts, enriching what I learn in 
         school. Even during free time, exploring the city allowed me to observe and experience new things on my 
         own.
