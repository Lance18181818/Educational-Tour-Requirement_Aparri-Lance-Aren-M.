        During our trip to Baguio, my friends and I visited different places and shared many fun experiences 
        together. We enjoyed sipping coffee at cozy cafes and even tried the famous strawberry taho, which made 
        the trip even more special. Exploring the city and trying new things created moments full of laughter and 
        joy. Every place we visited became a part of our unforgettable memories, from scenic spots to local markets.
         Sharing these experiences with my friends made our bond stronger and the trip more meaningful. I realized 
         that it’s not just the places we go to, but the people we are with that make memories last. This journey 
         in Baguio will always remain a cherished and unforgettable part of my life.        </p>
