           Our educational tour to Baguio filled me with
            excitement, especially because it was my first time visiting the 
            city. As soon as we arrived, the cool breeze and beautiful mountain 
            views made the trip feel unforgettable. I was amazed by every place we visited, 
            from the historical spots to the colorful markets that showed the rich culture of Baguio. 
            Exploring the city with my classmates made the experience even more meaningful and fun. Each moment 
            felt new and special, and I found myself learning not only from 
           the places we toured but also from the people around me.
